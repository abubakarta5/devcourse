        <p>Evan Williams, Twitter co-founder and former CEO, created Medium to encourage users to create posts longer than the then 140-character limit of Twitter. When it launched in 2012, Williams stated, "There's been less progress toward raising the quality of what's produced."<sup>[5]</sup> By April 2013, Williams reported there were 30 full-time staff working on the platform,<sup>[6]</sup> including a vacancy for a "Storyteller" role,<sup>[7]</sup> and that it was taking "98 percent" of his time.<sup>[6]</sup> By August, Williams reported that the site was still small, although he was still optimistic about it, saying "We are trying to make it as easy as possible for people who have thoughtful things to say".<sup>[8]</sup></p>
        <p>Medium has been focusing on optimizing the time visitors spend reading the site (1.5 million hours in March 2015), as opposed to maximizing the size of its audience.<sup>[9][10]</sup> In 2015, Williams criticized the standard web traffic metric of <a href='#'>unique visitors</a> as "a highly volatile and meaningless number for what we're trying to do".<sup>[10]</sup> According to the company, as of May 2017, Medium.com had 60 million unique monthly readers.<sup>[1]</sup></p>
        <p>Medium maintained an editorial department staffed by professional editors and writers, had several others signed on as contractors and served as a publisher for several publications. Matter operated from Medium Headquarters in San Francisco and was nominated for a 2015 <a href='#'>National Magazine Award</a>.<sup>[11]</sup> In May 2015, Medium made deep cuts to its editorial budget forcing layoffs at dozens of publications hosted on the platform.<sup>[12]</sup>Several publications left the platform.</p>
        <p>In 2016, Medium introduced <a href='#'>paywalled</a> content accessible only to subscribers.<sup>[13]</sup> In 2017, Medium began paying authors based on how much users expressed their appreciation for it through a like button which each user could activate multiple times.<sup>[14]</sup> The formula for compensation was soon adapted to also include the amount of time readers spent reading, in addition to the use of the like button.[15]</p>
        <p>Medium has brought in revenue through <a href='#'>native advertising</a> and <a href='#'>sponsorship</a> of some article series.<sup>[16]</sup> Medium gained several new publishers to host their content on the platform.<sup>[17]</sup> There was an aborted attempt to introduce advertising to the site, leading to Medium cutting its staff by 50 employees in January 2017, and closing offices in New York and Washington, D.C.<sup>[18][17]</sup> He explained that "we had started scaling up the teams to sell and support products that were, at best, incremental improvements on the ad-driven publishing model", but that, instead, Medium was aiming for a "new [business] model for writers and creators to be rewarded, based on the value they're creating for people".<sup>[18]</sup> At that time, the company had raised $134 million in investment from venture capital firms and Williams himself.<sup>[17]</sup></p>
        <p>In March 2017, Medium announced a membership program for $5 per month, offering access to "well-researched explainers, insightful perspectives, and useful knowledge with a longer shelf life", with authors being paid a flat amount per article.<sup>[19]</sup> Subsequently, the sports and pop culture website The Ringer and the technology blog Backchannel, both Condé Nast publications, left Medium. Backchannel, which left Medium for Wired in June, said Medium was "no longer as focused on helping publications like ours profit."<sup>[20]</sup> In October 2017, Williams reaffirmed Medium was not planning to pursue banner advertising as part of their revenue model and were instead exploring <a href='#'>micropayments, gratuities</a> and <a href='#'>patronage</a>.<sup>[15]</sup></p>
        <p>In 2016, 7.5 million posts have been published on the platform, and 60 million readers used medium.com.<sup>[21]</sup></p>
        <p>As of 2019, Medium is not profitable.<sup>[22]</sup></p>
        <p><h2>Corporate governance</h2><a href='#'>(edit)</a></p>
        <hr>
        <p>Medium initially used </a> and <a href='#'>holacracy </a>as its structure of <a href='#'>corporate governance </a>.<sup>[23][24]</sup> In 2016, they moved away from holacracy because they reported difficulty coordinating large-scale projects, dissatisfaction with the required record-keeping, and poor public perception of holacracy.<sup>[25][a]</sup></p>
        <p><h2>User information and features</h2></p>
        <hr>
        <p><h4>Users</h3><a href='#'>(edit)</a></p>
            <p>Medium does not publish official user stats on its website. According to US blogs, the platform had about 60 million monthly visitors in 2016.<sup>[26]</sup>. In 2015, the total numbers of users was about 25 million.<sup>[27]</sup></p>
            <p><h2>Platform</h2><a href='#'>edit</a></p>
            <p>In August 2017, Medium replaced their Recommend button with a "clap" feature, which readers can click multiple times to signify how much they enjoyed the article. Medium announced that payment to authors will be weighted based on how many "claps" they receive.[28]
            Users can create a new account using Facebook, or Google account. The users may also sign up using an e-mail address, when they are signing up using the mobile app of Medium.com. [29]</p>
         <p><h2>Memberships</h2></p>
         <p>Medium offers users subscriptions to become a member for a monthly or yearly fee of $5 or $50, respectively. With a Medium membership, access to "exclusive content, audio narrations of popular stories, and an improved bookmark section" is enabled.[30]</p>
         <p><h2>Tag system</h2></p>
         <p>A specific difference from Williams' earlier service, Blogger, is that posts are sorted by topic rather than writer.[31] The platform uses the system of "claps" (formerly "recommendations"), similar to "likes" on Facebook, to up vote the best articles and stories, called the Tag system, and divides the stories into different categories to let the audiences choose.</p>
         <p><h2>Publications</h2></p>
         <p>"Publications" on Medium are distributing hosts that carry articles and blog posts, like a newspaper or magazine. The articles published or saved on it can be assigned editors, and can be saved as drafts.</p>
         <p>Cuepoint, Medium's music publication, is edited by Jonathan Shecter, a music industry entrepreneur and co-founder of The Source magazine. It publishes essays on artists, trends, and releases, written by Medium community contributors, major record executives, and music journalists,[32] including Robert Christgau, who contributed his Expert Witness capsule review column.[33] Medium also published a technology publication called Backchannel, edited by Steven Levy.[34]</p>
         <p>On February 23, 2016, it was announced that Medium had reached a deal to host the new Bill Simmons website, The Ringer.[35] In August 2017 it left Medium for Vox Media.[36]</p>
         <p><h2>Reception</h2></p>
         <p>Reviewing the service at its launch in 2012, The Guardian enjoyed some of the collections that had been created, particularly a collection of nostalgic photographs created by Williams.[37] TechCrunch's Drew Olanoff suggested the platform might have taken its name from being a "medium"-sized platform in between Twitter and full-scale blogging platforms such as Blogger.[7]</p>
         <P>Lawrence Lessig welcomed the platform's affordance of Creative Commons licensing for user content,[38] a feature demonstrated in a Medium project with The Public Domain Review—an interactive online edition of Alice's Adventures In Wonderland, annotated by a dozen Carroll scholars, allowing free remixes of the public domain and Creative Commons licensed text and art resources, with reader-supplied commentaries and artwork.[39][40]</P>
         <p>However, in 2013 the service suffered criticism from writers, with some confused about exactly what it is expected to provide.[41]</p>
         <p>A 2019 Nieman Lab article chronicling Medium's first seven years described the site as having "undergone countless pivots", becoming "an endless thought experiment into what publishing on the internet could look like".[22]</p>
         <p><h2>Criticism and Controversy</h2></p>
         <p><h2>freeCodeCamp</h2></p>
         <p>On May 27, 2019 freeCodeCamp - one of the major content generator for Medium, left the platform citing extortion from Medium. As per the founder Quincy Larson's leaked email, Medium wanted the publication to include paywalls, and when they refused Medium tried to buy freeCodeCamp.[42][43][44]</p>
         <P><h2>Censorship</h2></P>
         <p><h3>Malaysia</h3></p>
         <p>In January 2016, Medium received a take down notice from the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia Commission for one of the articles published by the Sarawak Report. The Sarawak Report had been hosting its articles on Medium since July 2015, when its own website was blocked by the Malaysian government.[45]</p>
         <p>Medium's legal team responded to the commission with a request for a copy of the Malaysian Anti-Corruption Commission's official statement that the post was untrue, for information on which parts of the article were found false, and for information on whether the dispute has been raised in court. The site declined to take the content down until directed to do so by an order from a court of competent jurisdiction.[46] In response, on January 27, 2016, all content on Medium has been unavailable for Malaysian internet users.</p>
         <p>The ban has been lifted as of 18 May, 2018, with MCMC stating the ban lift was because "there was no reason (to block the website)" as the 1MDB report has been made public by the government.</p>
         <p><h3>Egypt</h3></p>
         <p>As of June 2017, Medium has been blocked in Egypt along with more than 60 media websites in a crackdown by the Egyptian government.[47] The list of blocked sites also includes Al Jazeera, The Huffington Post's Arabic website and Mada Masr.</p>
         <p><h3>China</h3></p>
         <p>In April 2016, Medium was blocked in mainland China[48] after information from the leaked Panama Papers was published on the site.</p>
         <p><h2>Software Architecture</h2></p>
         <p>Medium's initial technology stack relied on a variety of AWS services including EC2, S3, and CloudFront. Originally, it was written in Node.js and the text editor that Medium users wrote blog posts with, was based on TinyMCE.[49] As of 2017, the blogging platform's technology stack included AWS services, including EBS, RDS for Aurora, and Route 53, its image server was written in Go and the main app servers were still written in Node.[50]</p>
         <p><h2>Notes</h2></p>
